# Count-Inversion-using-Divide-and-Conquer-Approach

Here, the counting inversion is calculated by using Merge Sort(A Divide and Conquer Approach).

It will print the sorted array in ascending order first then print the number of counting inversion.

I have also write an ordinary way to find the Counting Inversion i.e. function named "countInv".
