# Count-Inversion-using-Divide-and-Conquer-Approach

This repository contains code for counting the number of inversions in an array using a divide and conquer approach based on the merge sort algorithm. In an inversion, a pair of elements in the array are out of order. The code calculates the total number of such inversions in the array.

# Prerequisites
* A basic understanding of merge sort algorithm.  
* Knowledge of divide and conquer algorithms.  
* Familiarity with programming in a language of your choice (the code provided is in Python)  
  
# Usage
* Clone the repository to your local machine.  
```git clone https://github.com/maomislive/Count-Inversion-using-Divide-and-Conquer.git```  
* Open the code file in your preferred development environment.  
* Provide the input array in the appropriate section of the code.  
* Run the code.  
  
The code will return the total number of inversions in the input array.  

# Code Explanation
The code follows the steps of the merge sort algorithm to divide the array into smaller subarrays and then recombine them in the correct order. During the recombination step, the code also keeps track of the number of inversions and increments the count for each inversion found.
